    <h2>About the Deaf Community</h2>
    <p>
      The deaf community is full of resilience and expression. People here speak with their hands and listen with their hearts. However, they often face many challenges in a world built for sound. Our project "Momo" aims to bridge that gap â€” with love, tech, and understanding.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges They Face</h3>

      <li>Limited access to sign language interpreters</li>
      <li>Barriers in education and employment opportunities</li>
      <li>Social exclusion and communication gaps</li>
      <li>Very few inclusive digital tools available</li>
    </ul>
