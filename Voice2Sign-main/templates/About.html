  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To create a world where communication is inclusive and seamless for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by leveraging technology and innovation.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to bridge the gap between spoken and sign language using AI-driven solutions that convert voice inputs into expressive sign language through animated avatars, making communication more accessible and natural.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation Behind the Project</h2>
  <p>
    Communication is a basic human right, yet millions in the deaf community face barriers every day. Our inspiration came from observing how difficult it is for hearing-impaired individuals to interact in a world designed for spoken language. We wanted to build a bridge — something meaningful, impactful, and inclusive. "Momo" is more than just a project; it's our step toward equal communication for all.
